# Unknown-ip-of-raspberry-pi
The way to now ip of running raspberry pi without screen.
If you are using raspberry pi zero ( not wireless) connected to your phone using tether and there's no screen to execute ifconfig on raspberry pi so technically there is no possibility to connect to your raspberry pi if local IP has changed. This script uses led on pin17 to blink as many times as 3rd and 4th sequence of ip. Now you know ip of device asuming it starts with 192.168
